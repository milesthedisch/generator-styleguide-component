# generator-styleguide-component
Makes creating components a lot faster.


To start a styleguide project, you will have to install Yeoman globally.

# install Yeoman

```
$ npm install -g yo
```
Check if the generator exsists.

```
$ yo --help
```
After you run this command you should see generator-styldeguide-component.

```
yo styldeguide-component
```
Then name your component.

ie. purple pimps.

Badabing Badaboom and you have a styleguide component.
